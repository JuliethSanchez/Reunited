The deportation and forced separation of immigrant families crossing into the United States has psychological effects on individuals and families and gives rise to a public health crisis that can affect entire communities, according to a new report published in the American Journal of Community Psychology. Children who lose a parent to sudden, forced deportation experience anxiety, anger, aggression, withdrawal, a heightened sense of fear, eating and sleeping disturbances, isolation, trauma, and depression. Children also experience housing instability, academic withdrawal, and family dissolution. Older children often need to take on jobs to help support the family. With families being separated by raids and children being inhumanely kept in detention centers or sent to far-flung locations, our team found it necessary to address this social injustice. Reunited provides a platform for families to find their missing children as well as a way for concerned citizens to report a child's information to help find their family. The web app compares two photographs of children and determines whether those two children are the same person with an accuracy of over 95%. This creates a match between parent and temporary caretakers in order to reconnect the children with their families.
